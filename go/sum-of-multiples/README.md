# Sum Of Multiples

Write a program that, given a number, can find the sum of all the multiples of particular numbers up to but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers up to and including 15 that are
multiples of either 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9, 10, 12, and 15.

The sum of these multiples is 60.

Write a program that can find the sum of the multiples of a given set of
numbers.

To run the tests simply run the command `go test` in the exercise directory.
